A web server is a software application that serves web pages and other content over the internet. It receives requests from clients (such as web browsers) and responds to those requests by sending back the requested content. A web server can handle various types of content, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and more. It is an essential component of the client-server model for delivering web applications and websites.
